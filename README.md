# Java GUI Compiler with Lexical Analysis

A lightweight and fully functional **Java IDE built using Swing** that allows you to write, compile, and run Java programs directly from a graphical user interface. The application also includes a built-in **Lexical Analyzer** to tokenize and analyze Java source code ‚Äî ideal for educational use and compiler learning.

---

##  Features

- ‚úÖ **Code Editor**: Java-specific text area with syntax-friendly font.
- ‚úÖ **Compile & Run**: Uses JavaCompiler API and reflection to compile and execute Java code.
- ‚úÖ **Console Output**: Integrated console for standard output and error messages.
- ‚úÖ **User Input Support**: Redirects console input (`System.in`) from GUI text field.
- ‚úÖ **Lexical Analysis**: Built-in analyzer that identifies keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, and more.
- ‚úÖ **File Operations**: New, Open, Save, Save As support for `.java` files.
- ‚úÖ **Error Feedback**: Compile-time and runtime exceptions are shown clearly in the console.

##  Getting Started

###  Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK 8+)
- Java IDE or Terminal to compile the `.java` file

###  Run Instructions

```bash
# Compile
javac JavaGUICompilerapp1.java

# Run
java JavaGUICompilerapp1
```

> üìå Make sure to run with a **JDK** (not just a JRE), as it requires the JavaCompiler API.
